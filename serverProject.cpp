Today 20/11/2022 I have started understanding the project, it is simple, there is client and server functions,
client has has 6 commands, 1- User, 2- LIST, 3- RET, 4-DEL, 5- SEND, 6- QUIT
each with different arguments, but the user will not use them, instead they will use a menue interface with numbers.
